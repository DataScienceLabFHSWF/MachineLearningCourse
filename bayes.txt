\section*{Task 3: Bayes Theorem}
A newly developed machine can detect counterfeit bills. We define the event
A: "The machine sounds an alarm", and event F: "The banknote is counterfeit". We would now like to
find out how high the probability is that a banknote is actually a counterfeit,
given the machine sounds the alarm. So what we are looking for is $P(F|A)$. The machine was tested with many
real and fake bills. It was found that the machine alarms on a counterfeit bill with 96\% confidence.
with 96\% certainty. However, the machine also gives an alarm for 1\% of the real bills.

are counterfeits. This also means that 99.99\% of the banknotes are not counterfeits.
